# frequency_response_testing
DAQ command script and plotting scripts used (MATLAB)
Imperial College London, Interventional Systems Neuroscience Lab (Grossman Lab)

This repository contains the MATLAB (R2022b) scripts and functions used as part of my BSc project on neuronal frequency response.
The main test script and functions were originally written by Dr Edward Rhodes with further modifications made by myself as required.
Additionally contained are raw data folders and some scripts for data analysis and modelling of a H-H neuron (modified by Assaf Touboul from MIT OCW 9.40).
The script is designed to be run from a device which has been connect to a National Instruments DAQ and Soterix linear current isolator.
See here for the exact protocol: (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8bedpf6kaubptpham5z9o/h?dl=0&rlkey=djzx6ujh6644k6zo63dh4u4ai)

The main script is titled Freq_Resp_DAQ_TACS_Control
